# Code Review Loop

Converge the current local branch through canonical review waves and narrowly authorized, verified remediation commits.

**Result:** a committed final HEAD whose fresh canonical full review says `Ready to merge` with no actionable findings, followed by passing project verification. **Next consumer:** the user or caller deciding whether to push or open a PR. **Done:** the complete success envelope, or a fully populated `Non-converged` envelope naming the blocker and next bounded cycle.

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Invoke `ce-code-review` through the host's callable skill mechanism for every global review wave. It is the sole review engine. Do not copy, paraphrase, reconstruct, or partially imitate its reviewer selection, dispatch, cross-model routing, synthesis, confidence gates, validation, severity, grouping, or action routing.

## Setup

Run this once at the start of this invocation, before any sub-skill or subagent dispatch, and follow the directives it prints except where they conflict with this skill's fail-closed interaction rules. Run the fence exactly as written as its own command: do not pipe, filter, truncate, or bundle it. Its output opens with `=== skill context` and ends with `CE_CONTEXT_END`; if exactly one marker is present, rerun the fence verbatim once. Otherwise never rerun it in the same invocation.

```bash
SKILL_DIR="<absolute path of the directory containing the SKILL.md you just read>";
NODE="$(for c in node nodejs; do command -v "$c" >/dev/null 2>&1 && "$c" -e '' >/dev/null 2>&1 && { echo "$c"; break; }; done)";
if [ -n "$NODE" ]; then
"$NODE" "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/context.mjs" || echo "context script failed; continue with the skill's normal behavior";
else
echo "no Node runtime; continue with the skill's normal behavior";
fi
```

## Input and Preflight

- Operate only on the **current local branch** and its current working tree. Accept optional `base:<ref>`, optional `plan:<path>`, and optional `max-work-units:N`.
- Reject a PR number, PR URL, branch target, or any other request to review or mutate a different checkout. Reject detached HEAD. Never switch scope to make an invocation work.
- Require a clean entry state: no staged, unstaged, or untracked changes. A dirty entry returns `Non-converged` before the first review and before mutation.
- Resolve `base:<ref>` once to a commit, then compute the diff merge base between the starting `HEAD` and that resolved commit. If omitted, first choose the repository's normal comparison ref. Freeze the helper's returned concrete merge-base SHA for the entire invocation; a supplied branch tip or direct SHA is an input to merge-base resolution, not itself the frozen diff base.
- Record the branch, frozen merge-base SHA, and **immutable starting HEAD**; never overwrite the starting HEAD in run state. Any later branch drift, unexpected HEAD drift, or tree change outside the active loop-owned remediation cycle is concurrent user work: preserve it and stop.
- `plan:<path>` must be readable when supplied and is forwarded unchanged to every canonical wave.
- `max-work-units:N` is optional. Default: `16`. It must be an integer of 2 or greater, with no upper bound. Invalid or conflicting input fails before the first wave with a populated `Non-converged` envelope.
- Before preflight, ask once whether this invocation may hand a converged result to a **dedicated publishing workflow** for push or pull-request creation. This is the startup **publication authority** gate. Default to `local-only` when the user declines, the question cannot be asked, or the invocation is non-interactive without explicit publication authority in the original request. Record the answer for the invocation; never ask again at completion.

Use the bundled deterministic helper for the Git mechanics it owns; do not improvise them. Every helper call is a fresh shell-tool invocation, so make it self-contained with this exact prefix and append exactly one operation from the table:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="<absolute path of the directory containing the SKILL.md you just read>";
NODE="$(for c in node nodejs; do command -v "$c" >/dev/null 2>&1 && "$c" -e '' >/dev/null 2>&1 && { echo "$c"; break; }; done)"; [ -n "$NODE" ] || { echo "no working Node runtime on PATH" >&2; exit 1; };
"$NODE" "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/loop-state.mjs" <operation and arguments>
```

| Operation | Arguments |
|---|---|
| `preflight` | `--repo <path> --base <ref>` |
| `validate-review` | `--repo <path> --expected <json-file> --review <json-file>` |
| `validate-final` | `--repo <path> --expected <json-file> --review <json-file>` |
| `cycle-authorize` | `--repo <path> --state <json-file> --paths-json <json-file> --verification-json <json-file> --family-json <json-file> --review <canonical-review-json> --base <resolved-base-sha> --packet <json-file>` |
| `cycle-begin` | `--repo <path> --state <json-file> --lease <lease-id>` |
| `cycle-recover` | `--repo <path> --state <json-file> --lease <lease-id>` |
| `cycle-status` | `--repo <path> --state <json-file> --lease <lease-id>` |
| `cycle-seal` | `--repo <path> --state <json-file> --lease <lease-id>` |
| `cycle-scope-expansion` | `--repo <path> --state <json-file> --lease <lease-id> --result <json-file>` |
| `cycle-cancel` | `--repo <path> --state <json-file> --lease <lease-id>` |
| `cycle-restore` | `--repo <path> --state <json-file> --lease <lease-id>` |
| `cycle-commit` | `--repo <path> --state <json-file> --lease <lease-id> --message <message>` |

Resolve the helper only through the loaded `SKILL_DIR` anchor. `preflight` must resolve `<ref>^{commit}`, compute `git merge-base HEAD <resolved-ref>`, and return one JSON object with `{status,input,branch,base_sha,head_sha,clean}` before any review or mutation. A missing commit or missing merge base is fail-closed `invalid_base`. Freeze the valid branch and returned merge-base SHA, and preserve the returned starting HEAD as immutable run history. Before **every** canonical wave, generate a per-wave expected JSON from the current clean checkpoint HEAD; never reuse the starting-HEAD expected JSON after a remediation commit.

## Workflow

Resolve `references/loop-protocol.md` relative to this `SKILL.md`, read it only when entering the workflow, and execute it in order. If unavailable, return `Non-converged` with the observed reason. Invoke canonical `ce-code-review` through one qualified **internal invocation channel**: prefer the host's direct callable skill mechanism; otherwise use one host-native child or isolated runner that loads and invokes the discovered canonical skill with the same repository/worktree context. The runner is an invocation adapter, not a substitute. Never read another skill's files, copy prompts, dispatch a generic review task, or reconstruct the pipeline. Slash/dollar forms are user-facing handoff text only; never execute `/ce-code-review` or `$ce-code-review` through a command surface. A slash-command lookup miss is not evidence that the skill is unregistered.

1. Perform the protocol's secure run-state setup. Invoke the self-contained helper fence with `preflight --repo <path> --base <ref>` and freeze the returned concrete merge-base SHA, branch, and immutable starting HEAD only when `status: "ok"`, `input: "valid"`, and `clean: true`.
2. Before every canonical wave, checkpoint the clean branch and current HEAD, then write a new per-wave expected JSON containing the frozen branch/base SHA and that current checkpoint HEAD. Spend one work unit and invoke exactly `ce-code-review mode:agent depth:full grouping:auto base:<resolved-base-sha>`, appending `plan:<path>` only when supplied. Prefer a qualified direct callable route; otherwise use one qualified host-native canonical skill runner. If dispatch definitely did not start, another already-qualified route may be selected. Once dispatch may have started, never retry, start a second canonical review, or switch routes.
3. Persist the exact canonical payload, then invoke the self-contained helper fence with `validate-review --repo <path> --expected <json-file> --review <json-file>`. Discard `malformed`, `coverage_gap`, `failed_review`, or `concurrent_change` results as convergence evidence. Ordinary valid waves require matching canonical `complete` status and full required-reviewer coverage, but may return any canonical verdict so `Ready with fixes` and `Not ready` remain usable for remediation.
4. Revalidate the exact `actionable_findings` against current HEAD, requiring every actionable object to remain canonically deep-equal to its source full finding, then partition them into independent mechanical defect families and decision-bearing blockers. Never treat triage organization as mutation authority.
5. Within the remaining scope and work-unit budget, remediate all independent mechanical families, one family per cycle. `cycle-authorize` is the **sole writable remediation entrypoint**: it validates the exact canonical review/family, acquires the checkout-scoped single-writer lease, checkpoints clean bytes, and generates the exact fixer packet. **Never batch or parallelize writable defect-family fixers.** Never dispatch from findings, triage summaries, or an ad-hoc prompt. Use `cycle-recover` only for a failed dispatch in this same invocation when authorization succeeded but `cycle-begin` definitely did not run; do not discover, adopt, or recover leases from an earlier invocation.
6. After those bounded mechanical families, if any decision blocker remains, stop and return `Non-converged`; never guess or converge through it. A blocker does not erase already verified independent mechanical commits.
7. **Any remediation commit invalidates every prior convergence claim. The next review unit must be a fresh canonical full review of the new HEAD with a newly generated per-wave expected JSON.** Reduced counts, lower severity, and passing checks are progress only.
8. Stop on `protocol_violation`, `commit_integrity_failure`, `restore_failed`, other integrity failure, `concurrent_change`, `verification_failed`, `commit_failed`, oscillation, or circuit-breaker exhaustion. Never amend or reset a created commit after an integrity mismatch. Otherwise repeat until the unchanged final HEAD's canonical payload passes `validate-final --repo <path> --expected <json-file> --review <json-file>`, then run final project verification.

If no route qualifies before dispatch, return `ce-code-review: skill_unreachable`. A deliberate slash/dollar parser misuse is `ce-code-review: invocation_adapter_error`, not proof the skill is unavailable. Once dispatch may have started, runtime failure, timeout, missing or truncated response, transport loss, wrong actual skill/arguments/checkout, or malformed response is `ce-code-review: invocation_execution_failure`; do not fallback. For pre-dispatch unreachable or adapter failure, include one copyable user-facing invocation in the active harness form using `mode:agent depth:full grouping:auto base:<resolved-base-sha>` and the optional plan. The rendered invocation is output only; never execute it inside the loop.

## Authority and Interaction

- Automatic repair authority covers **mechanical** findings only: repository evidence already establishes both the defect and required behavior, and verification can prove the fix without choosing new semantics.
- Product or design choices, public compatibility decisions, migration or rollout policy, unavailable external authority, and behavior not provable from repository evidence are decision-bearing blockers; do not guess through them. Return `Non-converged` with bounded decision context.
- Independent mechanical families may be committed before stopping for a decision blocker, but their completion never waives that blocker.
- Mutation is limited to the active defect family and its necessary callers, tests, fixtures, types, and contract documentation. Create exactly one **local commit** per verified family, normally `fix(review): <root cause>` or the repository's nearest valid convention.
- This loop must **never push** and must **never create or update a pull request**. It also never rebase, create a worktree, check out another branch, amend, squash, file a ticket, or rewrite remediation commits. Without affirmative startup confirmation, finish local-only. With affirmative startup confirmation, successful convergence may be handed to a dedicated publishing workflow; that workflow, not this loop, owns any push or PR action.
- Do not ask the user to bless incomplete reviewer coverage, stale evidence, malformed receipts, or a dirty/concurrently changed tree. Those are non-waivable failures.
- A decision-bearing finding is never resolved inside this invocation. Return `Non-converged` with bounded decision context so the user can make the decision outside this invocation, then rerun the loop. This invocation never turns a decision-bearing item or later user reply into automatic repair authority.

## Circuit Breaker

`max-work-units:N` prevents runaway repair; it is not a quality threshold. One **global review wave** consumes one unit and one **defect-family remediation cycle** consumes one unit, including a failed or discarded unit. Check budget before starting either. A successful final gate may consume the last unit; exhaustion without that gate is `Non-converged`, never success.

## Success and Failure Envelopes

On success, emit exactly this populated shape:

```text
Code review loop converged
Branch: <branch>
Base: <sha>
Final HEAD: <sha>
Review waves: <N>
Remediation commits: <N>
Final ce-code-review: Ready to merge, no actionable findings
Verification: <checks and outcomes>
Residual advisories: <none or residual_risks, testing_gaps, and advisory outputs>
```

On every failure, emit exactly this populated shape; use `none`, `unavailable`, or `not_reached` rather than omitting fields:

```text
Non-converged
Branch: <branch or unavailable>
Base: <sha or unavailable>
Starting HEAD: <sha or unavailable>
Last reviewed HEAD: <sha or not_reached>
Completed work units: <N global waves + remediation cycles>
Open actionable findings: <stable IDs and summaries or none>
Decision blockers: <list or none>
Reviewer coverage gaps: <list or none>
Verification failures: <list or none>
Concurrent change: <none or observed branch/HEAD/path change>
ce-code-review: <complete, degraded, failed, skill_unreachable, invocation_adapter_error, invocation_execution_failure, malformed, or not_run>
Next bounded cycle: <exact canonical invocation, defect family, or user decision>
```

## Completion Rules

Converge only after `validate-final --repo <path> --expected <json-file> --review <json-file>` accepts a valid canonical `mode:agent depth:full` wave that reviews the final unchanged HEAD, returns `status: complete`, `verdict: Ready to merge`, an empty `actionable_findings` queue, complete required-reviewer coverage, and no decision blockers; the branch and clean working tree must still match the receipt, and final project verification must pass on that HEAD. Report residual advisories without mutating them. Never push.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Correct response |
|---|---|
| Review human Markdown or reconstruct reviewer logic | Invoke canonical `ce-code-review` through the callable mechanism |
| Start from a dirty tree | Fail closed before review or mutation |
| Treat triage groups as the apply queue | Intersect stable finding numbers with `actionable_findings` |
| Apply a product decision as a straightforward fix | Preserve it as a decision-bearing blocker |
| Commit several unrelated families together | Verify and create one local commit per root cause |
| Dispatch writable fixers directly or in parallel | Authorize one family, pass the exact packet, require `cycle-begin`, and wait for terminal lease |
| Call a reduced finding count or passing tests success | Run a fresh full canonical wave and final gate |
| Continue after branch, HEAD, tree drift, or `commit_integrity_failure` | Preserve the created commit and all bytes; stop `Non-converged` |
| Treat work-unit exhaustion as completion | Return `Non-converged` with the next bounded cycle |

## Red Flags

- “The reviewer names tell me which ones were required.”
- “The quoted line is close enough.”
- “The plan probably intended this behavior.”
- “The tree changed, but my files are still fine.”
- “Tests pass, so another full review is wasteful.”
- “Only advisories remain, so the verdict does not matter.”
- “The limit was reached; report the best state as done.”

All mean: stop, preserve evidence and user work, and return `Non-converged` unless the protocol's final gate actually passes.
